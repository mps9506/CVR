## About

mpsCVR is a personal R package to automate generation of my CV and
resume. CVR is based heavily on
[datadrivencv](https://github.com/nstrayer/datadrivencv) and
[vitae](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae).

The CV templates within the packages are provided by
[svm-r-markdown-templates](https://github.com/svmiller/svm-r-markdown-templates),
licensed under MIT and by
[yaac-another-awesome-cv](https://github.com/darwiin/yaac-another-awesome-cv),
licensed under The LaTeX Project Public License. There are no plans to
release this package since it is heavily customized for my needs but
does not provide any additional functionality to the above codebases.

See [this repo](https://github.com/mps9506/CV-RMD) for a usage example.
