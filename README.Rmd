## About

mpsCVR is a personal R package to automate generation of my CV and resume. CVR is based heavily on [datadrivencv](https://github.com/nstrayer/datadrivencv), [vitae](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae), and templates provide by [svm-r-markdown-templates](https://github.com/svmiller/svm-r-markdown-templates). There are no plans to release this package since it is heavily customized for my needs but does not provide any additional functionality to the above codebases.

See [this repo](https://github.com/mps9506/CV-RMD) for a usage example.
